{"name":"Helioscan","tagline":"Microscopy software framework","body":"### Welcome to HelioScan.\r\nHelioScan is a software package for microscopy control applications providing high flexibility and easy extensibility. It as acts as:\r\n* a collection of software components providing combinatorial flexibility to match different hardware and functionality requirements;\r\n* a software framework within which you can develop new components in a structured fashion.\r\n\r\n### Scope and functionality\r\nHelioScan can be used for various imaging applications. It is particularly well suited for in vivo two-photon imaging applications. For different application scenarios, read our publication:\r\n\r\n[HelioScan: A software framework for controlling in vivo microscopy setups with high hardware flexibility, functional diversity and extendibility](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.02.006)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe [HelioScan wiki](https://github.com/HelioScan/HelioScan/wiki) provides an extensive documentation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nHelioScan is a community effort that was started in 2007 by Dominik Langer (@dominiklanger) in the research group of [Prof. Fritjof Helmchen](http://www.hifo.uzh.ch/research/helmchen.html). Over the years, significant contributions have been made by Marcel van 't Hoff (@marcelvanthoff), Andreas Keller, Maurice Göldi, Oliver Pfäffli, Marco Tedaldi and Hansjörg Kasper.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
